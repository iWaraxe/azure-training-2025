# Azure Training Course - 2025 Modernization Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the comprehensive modernization of the Azure Training program, bringing all three levels up to current Azure and technology standards while preserving the hands-on, practical training approach.

## 🎯 **Training Philosophy Maintained**

- **Code-First Approach**: Students write and deploy live infrastructure during sessions
- **Problem-Based Learning**: Learn by encountering and solving real deployment challenges  
- **Minimal Theory**: Short lectures (5-10 minutes) + extensive hands-on workshops (1+ hours)
- **Progressive Complexity**: Each level builds on the previous with increasing sophistication
